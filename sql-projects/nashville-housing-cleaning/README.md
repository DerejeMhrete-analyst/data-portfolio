# 🏠 Nashville Housing Data Cleaning (SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
A complete SQL-based data cleaning project using Nashville housing data (55,000+ rows).  
The goal was to prepare messy real-estate data for visualization and analysis by standardizing formats and removing inconsistencies.

## 🎯 Objective
To transform raw property transaction data into a clean, analysis-ready dataset for reporting and pricing insights.

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques
- MySQL (CTEs, Joins, CASE, Subqueries)
- Data type standardization and string operations
- Duplicate detection and removal
- Schema optimization for BI tools

## 🧠 What I Did
- Identified and removed duplicate records using CTE filters  
- Standardized date and address formats for cross-table consistency  
- Populated missing property types and normalized categorical fields  
- Eliminated redundant columns to simplify downstream reporting

## 📈 Insights
- Improved data reliability by **removing over 600 duplicate records**  
- Standardized inconsistent date and address formats for geospatial visualization  
- Revealed correlations between **property type** and **sale price** once the data was cleaned

## 🚀 Outcome
Produced a clean, structured dataset later integrated into Power BI for trend visualization and predictive housing analysis.
