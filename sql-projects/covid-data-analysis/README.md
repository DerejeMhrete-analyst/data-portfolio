# ðŸ¦  COVID-19 Data Exploration & Visualization (SQL + Tableau)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores global COVID-19 data using SQL and visualizes key metrics in Tableau.  
It demonstrates the ability to clean, aggregate, and extract insights from large, messy datasets â€” a core skill for analytical decision-making.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To analyze pandemic trends and uncover relationships between infection rates, testing levels, and mortality across different countries.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Techniques
- SQL (CTEs, Joins, Temp Tables, Window Functions, Aggregations)
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Tableau for dashboard visualization

## ðŸ§  What I Did
- Queried over **85,000 records** from a COVID-19 database  
- Standardized data types and handled missing entries  
- Created views for infection rates, death ratios, and testing coverage  
- Built a Tableau dashboard with interactive trend lines and filters

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights
- High-testing countries maintained significantly lower death-to-case ratios.  
- Infection peaks corresponded strongly with policy relaxation periods.  
- Regional comparison revealed temporal lag between outbreaks across continents.

## ðŸš€ Outcome
Delivered a full SQL-to-dashboard pipeline, showcasing the ability to turn raw data into meaningful, interactive business insights.
