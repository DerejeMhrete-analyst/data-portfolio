# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Industry Correlation Analysis (Python)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project investigates how various factors â€” such as **budget**, **gross revenue**, and **audience scores** â€” correlate within the movie industry.  
With over 7,000 records, it demonstrates how data analytics can uncover hidden business relationships in entertainment economics.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To identify which variables most strongly influence a movieâ€™s financial success and audience reception.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Techniques
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Correlation matrix and heatmap visualization

## ðŸ§  What I Did
- Cleaned missing values and standardized currency and numeric fields  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Generated correlation matrices to visualize relationships  
- Investigated the link between **budget**, **gross earnings**, and **IMDb ratings**

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights
- Strong positive correlation between **budget** and **gross earnings** (r â‰ˆ 0.73).  
- Weak correlation between **audience score** and revenue â€” marketing spend and genre had larger impacts.  
- Identified outliers among low-budget, high-earning films.

## ðŸš€ Outcome
Built a reproducible Python notebook demonstrating end-to-end data cleaning, correlation analysis, and visualization.
