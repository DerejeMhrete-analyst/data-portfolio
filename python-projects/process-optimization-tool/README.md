# 🧠 Process Optimization Tool – Python (Tkinter + Matplotlib)

## 📌 Reason
To support small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in identifying inefficiencies using video-based analysis.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- GUI design using Tkinter
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Building modular Python applications with database integration

## ⚙️ What I Applied
- Developed an interactive tool to process video-derived activity data
- Implemented heatmaps and spaghetti plots to visualize worker paths
- Integrated MySQL and Pandas for data management

## 🔍 What I Discovered
Visual data helps SMEs identify workflow bottlenecks and time inefficiencies more clearly than textual data.

## 📈 Outcome
A working desktop prototype used in a real SME case study to optimize production flow and resource allocation.
