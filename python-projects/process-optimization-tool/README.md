# ðŸ§  Process Optimization Tool (Python + Tkinter)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Developed a Python-based **video analysis and visualization tool** to help SMEs identify inefficiencies in production processes.  
This tool transforms time-stamped video observations into actionable insights using interactive heatmaps, Gantt charts, and path visualizations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To automate process analysis for small manufacturing firms and visualize workflow bottlenecks in real time.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Techniques
- Python (Tkinter, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn)
- Modular design with reusable plotting functions
- Interactive GUI for data exploration

## ðŸ§  What I Did
- Built a Tkinter GUI for uploading and visualizing video-derived data  
- Created heatmaps and spaghetti plots for worker path analysis  
- Integrated MySQL backend for structured data management  
- Designed a dashboard for drag-and-drop visualization comparison

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights
- The pilot test with a garment SME revealed a **25% idle-time reduction** opportunity.  
- Visual analytics made bottlenecks and waiting times immediately visible.  
- Demonstrated the business value of combining data analytics with process observation.

## ðŸš€ Outcome
Delivered a prototype tool later integrated into a masterâ€™s thesis on **Digital Tools for SME Process Optimization**.
